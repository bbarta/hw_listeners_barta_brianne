# Resources
1. [Understand the Event Listeners Panel](https://egghead.io/lessons/javascript-understand-the-event-listeners-panel) This video was a great starting point to really get another overview of event listeners. Although I was not successful, it helped me with #4.  

2. [W3 Schools Duplicating Children!](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/tryit.asp?filename=tryjsref_document_createelement2)
This resource helped me understand how to create each new paragraph on click for #4. 

3. [W3 Schools Click Event](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/tryit.asp?filename=tryjsref_document_addeventlistener)
I used this W3 Schools resource to help me learn about the mouseover functionality. I understood it from a click perspective, but then I decided to change the event. 

4. [HTML Form Elements](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_form_elements.asp) I'm embarrassed to say, but I needed a refresher on creating forms -- it's been a while! This W3 Schools page helped.

4. [W3 Schools DOM Events](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/dom_obj_event.asp)
This full list of DOM events helped me decide what to do for the 3 events of my choice. Lots and lots to choose from!


5. [W3 Schools OnCopy Tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/tryit.asp?filename=tryjsref_oncopy)
I used this W3 Schools resource to dissect and accomplish the oncopy event and it was a huge help!


# Deductions
I reviewed the list of deductions for this project and in the syllabus.

# Comments
Starting out, I was incredibly frustrated and overwhelmed while tackling this homework assignment. I had trouble with the first event listener and I let it drive me crazy, but I had no choice but to move on. I wish I had more time on this to really do more trial and error and get to the bottom of what I'm doing wrong, but the rest of the assignment got easier. I was very discouraged at first but I'm pretty happy with what I was able to accomplish! Thankfully, I used lots of resources. This stuff is HARD!
